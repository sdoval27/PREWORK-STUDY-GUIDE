# Sasha's Prework Study Guide

## Description

- This is the UCSD Coding Bootcamp Study Guide for my very first repository. The motivation for this project was to familiarize myself with the command line, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- I built this study guide with the intention of documenting useful beginner's notes that describe the complex front-to-back-end components used to structure and run a functional website. These notes are not comprehensive, however they do address concepts that are vital for a novice web developer to understand when they practice coding. 

- This project addresses the question many coding beginners have: Where do I start? This website acts as a jumping point for those with little-to-no experience in coding, both in the act of making the site, and by providing some structure and compartmentalization to vast knowledge that exists in the Web Developing world. 

- In conjunction with learning the vocabulary and syntax for Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I also developed computational thinking and troubleshooting skills. I learned tips for the instances where I made mistakes and had to backtrack. As a result, some of these tips appear in my Prework Study Guide notes.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

There are four boxes contanting the respective information for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. For the best user experience, it is recommended this information is read aloud to a rubber duck.

To access the DevTools console, Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
