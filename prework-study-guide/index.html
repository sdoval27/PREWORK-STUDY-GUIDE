          <li>An If statement is used to interrupt the control flow in a loop.</li>
          <li>Functions must be defined before you can call them.</li>
          <li>To define a function, first declare the function using a keyword, second provide instructions in the code block, then provide a console log.</li>
          <li>Once the function is defined, go to your console and type the keyword to call the function.</li>
